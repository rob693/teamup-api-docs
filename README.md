# TeamUp API Documentation (AI-Ready Extracted Edition)

This repository contains a fully structured, developer-friendly, AI-optimised documentation set for the **TeamUp API**.

It was generated by processing the original TeamUp HTML documentation into clean Markdown, normalised categories, and a machine-readable index.  
The purpose is to provide a reliable, search-friendly API dataset for:

- Internal systems development  
- n8n workflow automation  
- AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, custom RAG)  
- Technical onboarding  
- API research and analysis  
- GitHub-based documentation hosting  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

All documentation lives inside the `teamup_api_clean` directory, grouped into logical, simplified categories:

```
teamup_api_clean/
    attendance/
    auth/
    bulk-actions/
    crm/
    customers/
    discount-codes/
    events/
    external-calendars/
    invoices/
    memberships/
    payments/
    policies/
    providers/
    reports/
    store/
    venues/
    waivers/
    misc/
index.json
```

Each folder contains multiple `.md` files — each describing **one API endpoint**, using a consistent technical template.

---

## 🧱 Markdown Format (Technical Style)

Each endpoint file follows a stable structure:

```
# Endpoint Name

**Method:** GET  
**URL:** `/api/...`

## Summary
Short explanation of the endpoint’s purpose.

## Request Parameters
Heuristically extracted fields from the original documentation.

## Example Request / Response JSON
```json
{
  ...
}
```

## Errors
- 403  
- 404  
- 422  
```

This makes the content ideal for:

- Scripting  
- Code generation  
- AI retrieval  
- Workflow automation  
- Developer documentation  

---

## 🔍 `index.json`

The `index.json` file contains a machine-readable list of all endpoints, including:

- category  
- endpoint name  
- method  
- URL  
- summary  
- Markdown file path  

This is useful for:

- Building search tools  
- Embedding into a vector DB  
- Auto-generating OpenAPI specs  
- Building custom API explorers  
- Training or grounding LLM agents

## 🛠 How This Documentation Was Generated

The pipeline that produced this repo:

1. Raw TeamUp HTML docs were supplied from a full scrape.  
2. HTML was cleaned into plaintext.  
3. A Python extractor script applied heuristic extraction (Mode B) to identify:
   - HTTP method  
   - URL  
   - JSON request/response blocks  
   - Error codes  
   - Summary lines  
4. Endpoints were categorised using a broad normalisation system (e.g. all discount code endpoints → `discount-codes` folder).  
5. Clean Markdown files were generated for each endpoint.  
6. A structured folder hierarchy + index.json was created.

This process ensures both **accuracy** and **LLM readability**.

## 🤖 Using This Repo With AI Models

This dataset is optimised for LLM retrieval.  
You can load the entire repository into:

- **ChatGPT (via browsing or embeddings)**
- **Claude Projects**
- **A custom retrieval system (RAG)**

### Suggested prompt for ChatGPT / Claude:

```
You have access to a structured TeamUp API documentation repository.
When asked a question about TeamUp API usage, select the correct endpoint by:
1. Category
2. URL
3. Method
4. Summary and examples

Use the Markdown files to generate accurate request bodies, payloads, and workflow steps.
If multiple endpoints seem relevant, compare them clearly.
```
